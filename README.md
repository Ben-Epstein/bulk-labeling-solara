# bulk-labeling-solara
A tool for bulk labeling, built in Solara!

I'm trying to rebuild my original [bulk-labeling](https://github.com/rungalileo/bulk-labeling/) app, which was Streamlit, in [Solara](https://github.com/widgetti/solara) so it can be a bit more scalable, customizable, and robust to new features!

I also want to learn how to use solara :)
